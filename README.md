# ACME Company Initiative: Real-World Collaboration Model

## Overview

The ACME Company is a shared, fictitious organization designed to simulate real-world cloud enablement scenarios across infrastructure, platform, integration, data, and security teams.

This initiative serves as a sandbox for innovation, enabling teams to collaborate on joint proofs of concept (POCs), validate tools and methodologies, and generate reusable assets to drive both client work and internal marketing efforts.
Vision

The ACME Company environment empowers our teams to:
- Run joint POCs across different technologies and disciplines.
- Validate tools, methods, and approaches (e.g., Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD pipelines, governance models).
- Improve tribe collaboration through practical, hands-on scenarios.
- Generate reusable assets: templates, scripts, best practices, and diagrams.
- Enhance client delivery and innovation by applying lessons learned.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Contribute POCs, templates, and use cases to the ACME Knowledge Hub.
- Document your solutions clearly: diagrams, code, setup steps, and learnings.
- Collaborate across tribes and encourage cross-discipline innovation.
- Participate in retrospectives to share lessons learned.
